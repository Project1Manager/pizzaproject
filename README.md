# pizzaproject
### My final project for Nvidia. This program is not very good at, but still can somewhat tell the difference between a pizza with pineapple or without, with a 50% success rate.

### I'm actually not quite sure how to run the project, but if you open the file in VS Code, or some other application, and input an image of pizza, it should work, but I am not sure about the specifics as this was a bit rushed
